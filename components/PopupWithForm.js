// Create PopupWithForm as a child class of Popup. The class must comply with the following requirements:


// 1. It takes a callback of the form submission into the constructor, as well as the popup selector.


// 2. It stores a private method named _getInputValues(), which collects data from all the input fields.

// 3. It modifies the setEventListeners() parent method. The setEventListeners() method of the PopupWithForm 
  // class has to add the click event listener to the close icon while also adding the submit event handler.

//  It modifies the close() parent method in order to reset the form once the popup is closed.
// Create an instance of the PopupWithForm class for each popup.
